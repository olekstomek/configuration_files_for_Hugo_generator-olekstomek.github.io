# configuration_files_for_Hugo_generator-olekstomek.github.io
 Configuration files for Hugo - generating my own website olekstomek.github.io


This is the configuration for my [olekstomek.github.io](https://olekstomek.github.io) website.

By default, I add themes directory as a submodule, but to have a copy of the theme changes I used git clone.


You can check which files I changed - maybe it will help you with the configuration.
